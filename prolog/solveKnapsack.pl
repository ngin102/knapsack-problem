% ////MAIN PREDICATE/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

% This is the predicate that is called by the user; it calls all other predicates to solve the knapsack problem and to produce a solution file.
% Take a Filename as input (the name of the file that will be read for the information about the items being considered in the knapsack problem)
% and outputs the total maximum value of the items that can be stored in the knapsack (Value) and the list of the names of the items that are stored 
% in the knapsack which contains the combination of items that maximizes the total value of the knapsack (L_items_list).
solveKnapsack(Filename, Value, L_items_list) :-

	% Read the contents of the file with the inputted Filename and, from the file, extract the number of items being considered (N_numberOfItems),
	% the names of each item being considered (L_items_name), the values of each item being considered (L_items_value), the weights
	% of each item being considered (L_items_weight), and the total capacity/weight that the knapsack can hold (N_capacity).
	readFile(Filename, N_numberOfItems, L_items_name, L_items_value, L_items_weight, N_capacity),

		% Now, we formulate the first row of the dynamic programming tables; each row is represented by a list.
		% For this implementation, we essentially are creating two dynamic programming tables, which are built concurrently and correspond.
		% One table will contain the maximum total value of the knapsack with capacity 0, 1, 2 up to the total capacity that the knapsack can hold.
		% The other table will contain lists consisting of the names of the items that the knapsack will contain for each iteration of the knapsack problem;
		% again for the knapsack with the capacity 0, 1, 2 up to the total capacity that the knapsack can hold.

		% The row number of the table represents the number of items we have or attempted to add to the knapsack (based on the order of the items
		% as dictated in the .txt file inputted by the user).
		% The number of columns in our dynamic programming table equals N_capacity + 1 (since each column in this table represents a total number
		% of items being contained in the knapsack; which ranges from 0 up to the total capacity of the knapsack).
		NumberOfColumns is N_capacity + 1,

		% Create a list containing only zeros; the number of zeros in this list will equal the NumberOfColumns.
		% This list represents the first row of the dynamic programming table that considers the total value of the knapsack for a given capacity
		% (which will always be a list of zeros, since when considering 0 items that can be added to the knapsack, the knapsack will always
		% have a total value of 0 for 0 items).
		fillZero(NumberOfColumns, FirstRow),

		% Create a list containing only [] (empty lists); the number of empty lists in this list will equal the NumberOfColumns.
		% This list represents the first row of the dynamic programming table that considers the list of names of each item in the knapsack for a given capacity
		% (which will always be an empty list, since when considering 0 items that can be added to the knapsack, the knapsack will never contain any items).
		fillEmptyLists(NumberOfColumns, FirstNameRow),

		% Call the knapsack predicate with the list of item values (L_items_value), list of item weights (L_items_weight), list of item names (L_items_name), 
		% the first row of the table considering the total value of the knapsack for a given capacity (FirstRow), the first row of the table considering 
		% the names of the items contained in the knapsack for a given capacity (FirstNameRow), the index of the first item that can be added to the knapsack (0), 
		% the index of the first column in the table (0), the maximum capacity that the knapsack can hold (N_capacity), and the number of items being considered 
		% in total (N_numberOfItems). The predicate shall output a list representing the final row of the table considering the total value of the knapsack 
		% for a given capacity (FinalRow) and a list representing the final row of the table considering the names of the items contained the knapsack 
		% for a given capacity (FinalNameRow).
		knapsack(L_items_value, L_items_weight, L_items_name, FirstRow, FirstNameRow, 0, 0, N_capacity, N_numberOfItems, FinalRow, FinalNameRow),

		% Since FinalRow is a list, the last value in this list is the maximum total value of items that can be stored in the knapsack (Value).
		last(FinalRow, Value),

		% Since FinalNameRow is a list, the last sublist in this list is the list of the names of the items that maximize the total value of 
		% the knapsack (L_items_list).
		last(FinalNameRow, L_items_list),

		% Call the writeFile predicate for Value and L_items_list separately (so that they are written on separate lines of the file); provide
		% the filename of the original file that contained the information about all of the items being considered as Filename for this predicate, so
		% the solution file can be created in the form of Filename.sol.
		writeFile(Value, Filename),
		writeFile(L_items_list, Filename),

		% Display to the user that the solution has been written.
		display("Solution file written.").


% ////READING CONTENTS FROM THE FILE/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

% This is the predicate that reads the contents of the file with the inputted Filename. From the file, it extracts the number of items
% being considered (N_numberOfItems), the names of each item being considered (L_items_name), the values of each item being considered
% (L_items_value), the weights of each item being considered (L_items_weight), and the total capacity/weight that the knapsack can hold (N_capacity).
readFile(Filename, N_numberOfItems, L_items_name, L_items_value, L_items_weight, N_capacity) :-
	% Open the file with the given Filename.
	open(Filename, read, Input),

	% The first line of the file provided by the user will always be the number of items that are being considered when solving the problem.
	% Read the first line of the file and remove any unnecessary whitespaces using split_string; this line is now a list (L_numberOfItems).

	last(L_numberOfItems, S_numberOfItems),
	atom_number(S_numberOfItems, N_numberOfItems),

	% Then call the readLine predicate to read every other line of the file with N_numberOfItems as a parameter.
	% N_numberOfItems indicates the number of lines in the file that readLine will read and extract item information from.
	% Receive L_file as output, which will be the list of sublists that represent the information about each item in the file.
	readLine(Input, N_numberOfItems, L_file),
	% Call the getInfoFromList on L_file to separate the information in each sublist into separate lists for the names of each item (L_items_name),

	getInfoFromList(L_file, L_items_name, L_items_value, L_items_weight),

	% The last line of the file (the line after the line with the information of the last item) will always be the maximum capacity 
	% that the knapsack can hold. Read the last line of the file and remove any unnecessary whitespaces using split_string; this line
	% is now a list (L_capacity).
	read_string(Input, "\n", "\r", _, LastLine),

	% Take the last and only element of L_capacity as a string (S_capacity) and convert it into a number (N_capacity).
	last(L_capacity, S_capacity),
	atom_number(S_capacity, N_capacity).

	% We now have extracted all the information about the items from the given file.

% This is the predicate we will use to read every line of the file that represents an item. Input indicates the Stream we are reading from.
% NumberOfItems indicates the number of lines this predicate will read from the file (the number of items we will extract information for).
% This predicate will output a list containing sublists that represent the information about each item in the file (L_file).
readLine(Input, NumberOfItems, [L_line|L_file]) :-
	% Only call this predicate when NumberOfItems > 0 (else, there are no more items to consider).
	NumberOfItems > 0, !,

	% Read the line of the file (as S_line).
	read_string(Input, "\n", "\r", _, S_line),

	% Split S_line at each space; the contents of this split are placed into a list (L_line).
	% L_line will always contain three elements.
    split_string(S_line, "  ", " ", L_line),

    % Add L_line to the list (L_file) that contains all sublists that represent the information about each item in the file.
    % L_line is effectively a sublist in L_file.
    % Then recursively call readLine with the NumberOfItems decremented by 1.
    readLine(Input, NumberOfItems-1, L_file).

readLine(_, _, []). % Base case

% This is the predicate that we will use to separate the information in each sublist of the list containing all of the information about
% the items (L_file) into separate lists for the names of each item (L_items_name), the values of each item (L_items_value) and 
% the weights of each item (L_items_weight).
getInfoFromList([], [], [], []). % Base case.

	% Consider the first sublist in L_file (we take the head sublist of this L_file).
	% Take the first element of the sublist (Name), convert it into a char (C_Name) and add it to L_items_name.
	string_chars(Name, C_Name),

	% Take the second element of the sublist (Value), convert it into a number (N_value) and add it to L_items_value.

% ////WRITING SOLUTION FILE//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
% Adapted from lecture slides (https://uottawa.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/213483/viewContent/3528864/View):
% This is the predicate we will use to write to our solution file. X refers to the information that we will write to the solution file 
% and Filename refers to the name of the solution file.
writeFile(X, Filename) :- 
	% Remove the .txt from the inputted Filename, by calling split_string on Filename at the presence of the ".".
	% From the list outputted by split_string, take the head of this list (FilenameWithoutDot), as this is the Filename without .txt attached to it.
	split_string(Filename, ".", " ", [FilenameWithoutDot|_]),

	% The Filename of our solution will be Filename.sol; so concatenate .sol to FilenameWithoutDot. We now have the filename of our solution file.
	% (SolutionFilename).
	atom_concat(FilenameWithoutDot, '.sol', SolutionFilename),

	% Now we will start writing our solution information into the solution file (the file with the name indicated by SolutionFilename).
	open(SolutionFilename, append, F),
	write(F, X), 
	nl(F),
	close(F).

% ////FILLING THE KNAPSACK///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
% The predicates we will call to fill the knapsack in the knapsack problem.
% solveRow simulates the iteration along a row in the dynamic programming tables, and the insertion of values into this row.
% knapsack is used to recursively call solveRow to create each row in the tables.

% As parameters, knapsack takes the list of item values being considered (L_item_value), the list of item weights being considered (L_itemWeight),
% the list of item names being considered (L_itemName), the row of the dynamic programming table for item values that we will use to generate
% the next row in that table (PreviousRow), the row of the dynamic programming table for item names that we will use to generate the next row
% in that table (PreviousNameRow), the current item being considered represented by its ordering in the file (CurrentItemIndex), the current capacity
% of the knapsack being considered (CurrentCapacity), the maximum capacity that the knapsack will hold (MaxCapacity), and the number of times the knapsack
% predicate still needs to be recursively called/the number of rows in the tables that still need to be generated (Count).
% As output, we receive the last row of the table representing the item values (Z) and the last row of the table representing item names (A).

% Case 1:
knapsack(L_item_value, L_itemWeight, L_itemName, PreviousRow, PreviousNameRow, CurrentItemIndex, CurrentCapacity, MaxCapacity, Count, Z, A) :-
	% If Count is greater than 0...
	Count > 0, !,
	% Generate the current rows of each of the tables (X and Y) based on the rows provided (PreviousRow and PreviousNameRow) by calling solveRow...
	solveRow(L_item_value, L_itemWeight, L_itemName, PreviousRow, PreviousNameRow, CurrentItemIndex, CurrentCapacity, MaxCapacity, X, Y),
	% ...and then use those generated rows (X and Y) to generate the next rows of the table (Z and A) until we reach Case 2; decrement Count by 1.
	knapsack(L_item_value, L_itemWeight, L_itemName, X, Y, CurrentItemIndex + 1, CurrentCapacity, MaxCapacity, Count-1, Z, A).

% Case 2: If Count is 0, stop.
% The outputs are the inputs for the parameterized PreviousRow and the PreviousNameRow.
knapsack(_L_item_value, _L_itemWeight, _L_itemName, PreviousRow, PreviousNameRow, _CurrentItemIndex, _CurrentCapacity, _MaxCapacity, Count, PreviousRow, PreviousNameRow) :-
	Count =:= 0, !.


% The solveRow predicates are the predicates that are used to generate a row of the tables.
% As parameters, solveRow takes the list of item values being considered (L_item_value), the list of item weights being considered (L_itemWeight),
% the list of item names being considered (L_itemName), the row of the dynamic programming table for item values that we will use to generate
% the next row in that table (PreviousRow), the row of the dynamic progamming table for item names that we will use to generate the next row
% in that table (PreviousNameRow), the current item being considered represented by its ordering in the file (CurrentItemIndex), the current capacity
% of the knapsack being considered (CurrentCapacity), and the maximum capacity that the knapsack will hold (MaxCapacity).
% Each predicate will output the row of the value table that we are generating (NewRow) and the row of the item name table that we are generating (NewNameRow).

% Case 1:
% When the CurrentCapacity being considered is 0, add 0 to NewRow (as the total value when 0 items are placed in the knapsack is always 0).
% When the CurrentCapacity being considered is 0, add [] to NewNameRow (since 0 items are placed in the knapsack, there will be no item names).
solveRow(L_item_value, L_itemWeight, L_itemName, PreviousRow, PreviousNameRow, CurrentItemIndex, CurrentCapacity, MaxCapacity, [0|NewRow], [[]|NewNameRow]) :-
	CurrentCapacity =:= 0, !, % Conditions of Case 1 met.

	% row of the table).
	solveRow(L_item_value, L_itemWeight, L_itemName, PreviousRow, PreviousNameRow, CurrentItemIndex, CurrentCapacity + 1, MaxCapacity, NewRow, NewNameRow).

% Case 2:
% The CurrentCapacity being considered is less than or equal to the MaxCapacity that the knapsack can hold, and the weight of the current item that is
% being considered is equal to the CurrentCapacity being considered. We check if the singular value of the current item being considered is greater than the value
% of the combination of items that maximized the total value of the knapsack for the same capacity, but for one less item considered (the same column in the
% previous row of the values table/the column in the previous row of the values table with the same CurrentCapacity). If this is the case, add the value of the
% current item being considered to NewRow and add a sublist containing the name of this item to NewNameRow.
% The current item alone maximizes the total value of the knapsack better than the previous combination of items for this capacity.

% of the combination of items that maximized the total value of the knapsack for the same capacity, but for one less item considered (the same column in the
% previous row of the values table/the column in the previous row of the values table with the same CurrentCapacity). If this is the case, add the value from the
% previous row to NewRow and add a sublist containing the names of the items from the previous row to NewNameRow.
% The previous combination of items for this capacity maximizes the total value of the knapsack better than the current item alone.

% Case 4:
% The CurrentCapacity being considered is less than or equal to the MaxCapacity that the knapsack can hold, and the weight of the current item that is
% being considered is greater than the CurrentCapacity being considered. This means we can not add this item to the knapsack for this current capacity.
% Consider the combination of items that maximized the total value of the knapsack for the same capacity, but for one less item considered (the same column in the
% previous row of the values table/the column in the previous row of the values table with the same CurrentCapacity). Add the value from the
